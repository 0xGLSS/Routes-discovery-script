# Routes Discovery Script

Discovering vulnerabilities within a network is a crucial aspect of penetration testing, and the Routes Discovery Script simplifies this process. This open-source tool automates the discovery of hosts within a network and identifies known exploits present on those hosts.

# How It Works

The script operates by parsing default routes and monitoring for any changes. When a user connects to a VPN server, the script dynamically detects newly added routes and presents them for analysis.

Subsequently, the script initiates a multi-threaded scan targeting the identified routes to uncover potential vulnerabilities.
